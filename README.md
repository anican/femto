# femto
An extensible text editor in the style of vim 

After adopting vim as my primary text editor, I became increasingly fascinated with how
text editors work, and this project is my attempt to learn more about the internals behind
the text editors we know and love today. The technology is quite old but still extremely
useful.


documentation forthcoming... For now, please reference the commenting within /src

TODO
- bash script file and aliasing so that users can open up femto 
  with a 'femto' command in the terminal as opposed to ./femto
